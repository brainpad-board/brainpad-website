While coding can be done on a PC, students' eyes light up the moment they see their code come to life on a circuit that they can touch. The instant gratification keeps students engaged and excited about coding. With technology taking over every aspect of our lives, students see the world around them differently once they realize there is code inside the microwave oven! Their use and understanding of "smart devices" have a different meaning after just a few BrainPad lessons.

Excitement about technology continues beyond the classroom with BrainPad by encouraging students to go outside structured learning at school and unleash their imagination at home. Some of the best million-dollar ideas were born at home, starting some of the largest tech companies.
