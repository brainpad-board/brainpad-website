# 2D Adventure Series

In this series we will create a 2D adventure type game. Weâ€™ll learn about creating Sprites, moving them, and using collision detection when Sprites overlap.

## Target Audience

Anyone 13+ will find benefit from this series. Younger audience can still follow along when paired with an adult. An example can be a pops/grandchild STEM weekend event!

## Setup 

You will need any computer with a modern internet connection. Windows, Mac, and even Chromebook will work! You actually can use a tablet but that is not recommended.

Having a BrainPad is optional but highly recommended. Making a game on a PC is fun, but nothing is more engaging to learners than taking the game they made and load it on a device they are holding in their hands.
