# Space Shooter Series

In this series we will create a Space Shooter game. Weâ€™ll learn about adding Sprites, moving Sprites, creating projectiles, and collision detection between Sprites.

Target Audience: Anyone 13+ will find benefit from this series. Younger audience can still follow along when paired with an adult. An example can be a pops/grandchild STEM weekend event!

Setup: You will need any computer with a modern internet connection. Windows, Mac, and even Chromebook will work! You actually can use a tablet but that is not recommended. Having a BrainPad is optional but highly recommended. Making a game on a PC is fun, but nothing is more engaging to learners than taking the game they made and load it on a device they are holding in their hands.

All lessons have to be done in a sequence but can be stopped at any lesson. All lessons are designed to be 20-min or learning and 40-min of lab/hands-on. See the Lesson Plans home page for details.
