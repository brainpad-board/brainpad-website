# Analog vs Digital

In this lesson, students will learn about digital and analog values and differences.

## Target Audience

Anyone 13+ will benefit from this series. Younger audiences can still follow along when paired with an adult. An example can be a pops/grandchild STEM weekend event!

## Setup

You will need any computer with a modern internet connection. Windows, Mac, and even Chromebook will work!

And you will need an RGB LED and alligator clips with BRainPad Arcade.

And you need to finish the previous [Edge Pads](/docs/resources/lessons/edge-pads) project.

## Analog vs Digital PINs

In the previous project, we connected an RGB LED and controlled it using the `digital write pin` command, and we noticed there were only two values: `HIGH` and `LOW`. In this project, we will learn more about `analog write` and the differences between analog and digital.

After opening a new project, go to `Pins` and drag `analog write pin` and you will notice that we have many values this time instead of `HIGH` and `LOW`.

This value sets the power level on the pin, which means it sets the RGB LED brightness in this situation. The value range from 1023 as max and 0 as min.

To try different brightness levels, letâ€™s try to make it 50%, half of 1023.

And here it is at 10%.

To understand the analog values more, you can use a Loop and a variable, so you will set the starting value to 0, and increase it by 1 inside the loop.

You will notice how the LED brightness will increase one by one.

Analog and digital are methods of representing a value. Analog signals are continuous and vary smoothly over time, much like a wave. Think of it like a line graph where the values can change at any point along the line.

Digital signals, however, are discrete and represented using a series of binary digits (0s and 1s). It's like using a set of switches that are either on or off to represent information.
