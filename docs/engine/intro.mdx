# Internal Engine

---

DUELink modules run an Internal Engine that is used to handle commands over multiple [Interfaces](../interface/intro), which include handling a stream of [DaisyLink](./daisylink) modules on the [Downlink](../interface/downlink) socket.

The engine is also used to extend the system capabilities and make it possible for the system to run [Standalone](./standalone).

The DUELink Engine has two modes `Immediate Mode` where commands are executed immediately, and `Record Mode` when commands are stored internally in the module.

:::note
DUELink [Console](../console) handles both commands without the users needing to understand any details. This section help in understanding the engine internals.

## Immediate Mode

`Immediate Mode` is ideal for sending single line command to trigger actuator into action or read sensor data for example. A command can be `statled(200,200,50)` to blink the status LED 50 times with a 200ms on/off interval. It is possible to send multiple commands in a single `Immediate Mode` shot by adding `:` between commands. For example: `statled(200,200,50):Print("DUELink")`.

To test the interworking of the engine manually, instead of using [Console](../console), open a terminal software and connect it to the serial port presented by the connected DUELink module. We like [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

Hitting the escape key will result with `>` prompt. This is the `Immediate Mode` prompt. Entering `>` is also the command to switch to `Immediate Mode`. Keep a note of this once you switch to `Recording Mde` later.

:::note
Immediate Mode is the default mode when device is first connected.
:::

Type `Print("Hello World")` and hit enter. The engine will execute the `Print` command and show `Hello World`.

:::tip
The engine handles backspaces and left/right arrows to help in editing the entered commands. It even has entered-command-history that can be fetched using up and down arrow keys.
:::

Immediate Commands typically come from one of the [Supported Systems](../system/intro) over one of the [Interfaces](../interface/intro).

---

## Record Mode

`Record Mode` takes the received commands and stores them internally. Those commands can be executed using `run` command. Use `list` to see a list of recorded commands, and `new` to erase everything and start new.

The `Record mode` is entered using the `$` command. This will also switch the prompt to `$`. All statements entered are stored internally and _not_ executed. The `run` command can be used to execute the program. The device will also automatically `run` a program on power up.

:::note
The commands `run`, `list`, and `new` are never recorded! They are used to handle the recorded program.
:::

Go ahead and enter `$` and press the enter key.
![Tera Term Record Mode](pathname:///img/teraterm-record.png)

Add three lines of `print` commands. Nothing will get executed as those commands are getting stored internally, not executed. When finished, use `list` to see the commands.

![Tera Term Print](pathname:///img/teraterm-print.png)

Use `run` to run the program.

![Tera Term Run](pathname:///img/teraterm-run.png)

Add another command to the list then try to run again.

![Tera Term Add Item and Run](pathname:///img/teraterm-additem-run.png)

use `new` to erase the program. Verify the program is removed using `list`.

![Tera Term New](pathname:///img/teraterm-erase.png)

:::note
It is not possible to modify individual lines once recorded. This is not a problem when using the [Console](../console) as it sends the program complete in one shot.
:::

We can run a program that runs indefinitely using loops.

```py
@Loop
Print("Hello")
Print(" world")
Print(" 123!!")
goto Loop
```

![Tera Term Loop](pathname:///img/teraterm-loop.png)
![Keyboard Esc](pathname:///img/keyboard-esc.png)

A running program can be terminated by hitting the ESC key. Hit escape, then 'new' to erase the program. Verify using 'list'.

Recording programs are either used to run the module [Standalone](./standalone) or to extend the module's functionality. We call this `Hybrid Mode`.

---

## Hybrid Mode

There is no `Hybrid Mode` exactly, but you can combine both immediate and record modes to extend the system with additional commands. Say we want to extend the system with a `Hello()` function. We can record this extension that can be executed immediately.

Enter recoding mode then start a `new` program. Then Enter this program:

```py
fn Hello(b1)
Print("Hello ")
Println(b1)
fend
```

Now, `list` the program to make sure it was recorded properly.

![Tera Term Function](pathname:///img/teraterm-function.png)

Switch to immediate mode and enter `Hello("John Due")`.

![Tera Term Function Print](pathname:///img/teraterm-function-print.png)

This is exactly how hundreds of modules provide user-friendly drivers. They all have a recorded script that handles module-specific tasks. Then these drivers commands can be executed from a [Supported System](../system/intro) over one of the [Interfaces](../interface/intro).

# Asynchronous Immediate

When the system in 'run' mode, running a loop, it is possible to inject other code to run asynchronously. Use `asio(1)` to enable this feature.

Consider this program that loops and print the global variable \_x every 500ms.

```py
asio(1)
while 1
println(_x)
wait(500)
wend
```

With Asynchronous immediate enabled, we can now inject `_x=5` at any time to change the output to 5.

This can also be used to call functions and even run loops! Any valid single-line commands can be injected asynchronously.

This is a simple program that prints whatever is in a1 every 500ms.

```py
asio(1)
fn SetA1(a2)
a1 = a2
fend

SetA1("Hello")

while 1
println(a1)
wait(500)
wend
```

Now we can inject `SetA1("DUELink")`. Of course, you can just do `a1[]="Try it"` but we used a function to show the possibilities.
