# Coprocessor

---

Some modules require a coprocessor that handles specific tasks. The DUELink's engine includes facilities to help with updating the coprocessor's firmware and also includes special commands for cross-chip communication.

Extension scripts are always included to simplify the use of the coprocessor. These functions are provided for reference only.

## Firmware Control

These functions are provided to update the firmware running on the coprocessor.

| Function    | Description                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CoprocE()` | Erase entire flash on coprocessor.                     |
| `CoprocP()` | Upload application (firmware), use XModem 1K protocol. |
| `CoprocS()` | Reset coprocessor.                                     |

---

The upload command simply opens up an xmodem 1K transfer through the main micro. Once `CoprocP()` is called, the system will start sending `CCCCC...` back indicating the coprocessor is ready for the new firmware. Any xmodem software, including TeraTerm, can be used to send the firmware. Do not forget to select the 1K option.

The other two commands are for erasing the firmware and for resetting the coprocessor.

### Application Command

Once a coprocessor firmware is loaded, these commands provide means of data transfer between the system's main micro and the coprocessor.

| Function          | Description                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `CoprocV()`       | Return current firmware version on coprocessor. |
| `CoprocW([data])` | Write a byte array to coprocessor.              |
| `CoprocR([data])` | Read byte array from coprocessor.               |

These functions are used by us to build drivers that you can simply use. WE are documenting these here for reference only.
