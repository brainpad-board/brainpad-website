# File System

A complete FAT file system is a built in the DUELink firmware. It includes, FAT16, FAT32, Long-File-Name (LFN), directory handling, and several file-processing functions. It is limited to 2 GBytes size files! Thanks to [Elm Chan](http://elm-chan.org/docs/fat_e.html) for the awesome open-source FAT library.

## Mount

Mount and initialize the file system. Only one media is supported at any given time.

| Function                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `FsMnt(type, cs, baud, max_handle)` | Enable file system to a specific `type` of media on SPI bus with `cs` chip-select pin at `baud` KHz, with maximum allowed file handles `max_handle`. Returns 0 if success. |
| `FsUnMnt()`                         | Release file system. Returns 0 if success.                                                                                                                                 |
| `FsFmt(type, cs, baud)`             | Format the mounted media. Note that this takes several minutes to complete.                                                                                                |

| 2   | USB                                  |

## File Operations

:::tip
Unless otherwise stated, all functions return 0 or positive for error code (error code 0: success), or negative on failure.

| Function                  | Description                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FsOpen("path", mode)`    | Returns a file handle on success. 0 or negative on failure.                                                               |
| `FsClose(handle)`         | Close file and release `handle`.                                                                                          |
| `FsWrite(handle, [data])` | Write from `data` array. Returns how many bytes were write, negative error code otherwise.                                |
| `FsRead(handle, [data])`  | Read into `data` array. Returns how many bytes were read, negative error code otherwise.                                  |
| `FsSync(handle)`          | Sync file with any buffered data.                                                                                         |
| `FsSeek(handle, offset)`  | change the location in the `handle` file on where to read or write.                                                       |
| `FsTell(handle)`          | Returns the current location being access in `handle` file.                                                               |

| `FsFind("path")`          | Find if existing name is available. Returns the item type if found, return 0x10 for directory, 0x20 for file for example. |
| `fsfsz("path")`           | Returns `path` file size, negative number on failure.                                                                     |

File Open Modes
| ID | mode
| --- | ---
| 0x01 | Read only
| 0x02 | Write only
| 0x00 | Open existing. Require existing file, or return -1
| 0x04 | Create new. Require NOT existing file, or return -1
| 0x08 | Create always. Force create new. If file is already exit, it will be deleted for new file
| 0x30 | Open append. If not exist, create one

:::tip
Combine multiple modes, like use `FsOpen("/test.txt", 0x02|0x0x30)` to open a file for write and append if existing.

## Directory Operations

| Function                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `FsFNext([name], [type])` | Finds the next item and fills in `name` with the next file or directory it found in an open directory using `FsOpDir()`. `type` is a single byte array containing the item type in standard FAT file system format, for example [0x10] for directly and [0x20] for files. |


```py
# file open types
_r = 0x01 # Read only
_w = 0x02 # Write only
_x = 0x00 # Open existing. Require existing file, or return -1
_n = 0x04 # Create new. Require NOT existing file, or return -1
_c = 0x08 # Create always. Force create new. If file is already exit, it will be deleted for new file.
_a = 0x30 # Open append. If not exist, create one.

Dim b1[] = "Hello World"

# SD card, pin 17 chip select, 8Mhz clock, 4 file handles max
fsmnt(1, 17, 8000, 4)

# Write b1 array to a file
h = FsOpen("/test.txt", _w|_c)
FsWrite(h, b1)
FSClose(h)


# Read from the same file to b2 array
h = FsOpen("/test.txt", _r)
Dim b2[11]
FsRead(h, b2)
Println(b2)
FSClose(h)

fsunmnt()
```

## USB Memory Drives

Accessing files on USB thumb drives is dome exactly same as SD. Type 2 media is USB memory. The second and third arguments are ignored in USB host mode.

```py
# USB thumbdrive, 4 file handles max
fsmnt(2, 0, 0, 4)
```

:::tip
The use of USB Host requires a special co-processor, which is already included on modules such as [USB Host](../catalog/com/usb-host).
