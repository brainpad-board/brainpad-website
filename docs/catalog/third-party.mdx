# Third-party Modules

None have been made yet! Are you making the first one?

---

DUELink is designed with one important goal in mind, to work with all other ecosystems and allow users to make their own modules! We are giving you everything you need to make your own DUELink modules. We only ask you not to use GHI Electronics and DUELink logos without written permission from us, see [Legal Licensing](../legal) for details.

We have got you covered, from hardware to software:

## Hardware

The micro we use on DUELink is STM32C071. You can integrate this micro on your modules and you are halfway to having your own DUELink modules! If you are not comfortable using a very tiny QFN32 chip, we have made [Stick](microcomputer/stick), which brings all the connections to 0.1” headers and castellated holes. It also includes both U and D sockets.

The [Sticker](./accessory/sticker), is the development board for the [Stick](./microcomputer/stick.mdx), which brings all its available connections to pin headers for easy prototyping and testing.

We also offer [Stamp](microcomputer/stamp) an ultra-small board with USB C connector on-board.

## Software

There isn’t much you need to do on the software front. We have shared the firmware hex files so you can simply load on your own creations, free for commercial and non-commercial use. Everything you need is on the [Downloads](../downloads) page.

## Specifications

The [Specifications](../specs) page includes details on dimensions, connections, and everything necessary to build custom modules.
