## Charging your BrainBot

Plug a micro-USB into the BrainBot (you can use the one that came with your BrainPad). Ensure that the battery is fully inserted into the battery holder. The Charge LED will illuminate. The battery will be fully charged when the Charge LED turns off. The battery that is included is a Li-Po battery and requires special care. Please read the Safety Page carefully.

## BrainBot Pinout

The BrainBot components connect to the BrainPad through the edge connector. The pinout of the BrainPad is shown on its product page. This section shows the BrainPad pin connections on the BrainBot. This is advanced info at this point as we provide a pre-made driver for you to use the BrainBot with ease.
