# Specifications

---

DUELink unifies many aspects allowing modules to come in any shape and form and still conform to unified user experience.

## Connections

![JST Connectors](pathname:///img/jst-specs.png)

Connections between modules and to microcomputers is accomplished using standard 4pin 1mm pitch JST connector. These low-cost and common connectors are very small that you can throw on anything without compromising space. They are available in SMT for fast machine placement and in TH in case you need to hand solder them.

![Pinout](pathname:///img/pinout.png)

The pinout consists of:

1. Common Ground
2. Regulated 3.3V
3. DRP
4. CTN

:::info
DRP: [I2C](interface/i2c) SDA (Data), [UART](interface/uart) RX (Receive), and [USB](interface/usb) D+ (Positive).

CTN : [I2C](interface/i2c) SCL (Clock), [UART](interface/uart) TX (Rransmit), and [USB](interface/usb) D- (Negative).
:::

Each module includes both Uplink (white) and [Downlink](interface/downlink) (blue) connectors.

![Uplink & Downlink](pathname:///img/uplink-downlink.png)

The Uplink connector is used to connect the module to a microcomputer, such as Raspberry PI or Arduino, or a PC. It automatically works with [I2C](interface/i2c), [UART](interface/uart), and [USB](interface/usb).

![Other Micros](pathname:///img/other-micros.png)

When USB is mostly desired on specific boards, a USB C connector is used instead of the JST Uplink socket. This is the case with [DueDuino](catalog/microcomputer/dueduino) for example.

![DueDuino](pathname:///img/dueduino-uplink.png)

Every single module can still access USB by wiring a USB connector the Uplink socket. We also offer [USB Hook](catalog/accessory/usb-hook) for convenience.

![USBhook to Servo](pathname:///img/usbhook-servo-x1.png)

In some rare case, a module might have both Uplink and USB connector, like we have on [Ghizzy](catalog/microcomputer/ghizzy.mdx). In this case, the user can use either USB or Downlink as they are both wired together internally.

![Ghizzy Connections](pathname:///img/ghizzy-connections.png)

DUELink Uplink connection is compatible with Sparkfun Qwiic and Adafruit STEMMA QT.
Both use I2C, which is one of options available on any DUELink Uplink connection.

![Uplink](pathname:///img/uplink.png)

Always connect the non-DUELink modules first in line with the microcomputer then add as many DUELink modules as the wires can handle!!

The second connector is Downlink. It connects to the next modules' Uplink socket.

![Downlink](pathname:///img/downlink.png)

Each module has intelligence to know what to transfer and return throughout the entire stream. Only connect DUELink modules on the downlink connection. More details are on the [Downlink](interface/downlink) page.

:::info
Uplink JST connectors must be white, while Downlink JST connectors are blue. The Uplink and Downlink connectors must also be clearly marked with U and D respectively. 
:::

:::tip
Tip: When looking at the front of the module, we recommend placing the U socket on the left side, with D socket on the right.

## Status LED

![Status LED](pathname:///img/status-led.gif)

Each DUELink module must include a STAT (Status) LED. This is used to indicate the current status on the module and can also be user-accessed using the `StatLed()` command. On boards that have parts on both sides, STAT LED must be on the front face of the module.

On power up, the STAT LED shows the device status. It first blinks fast @ 50ms once of the interface is USB/UART and twice if I2C. And then it blinks slower @ 100ms when the device gets enumerated. It will blink the count of its own address. For example, the 5th device in the daisylink will blink slow 5 times. From that point on, the LED will light up whenever the module is busy executing a command.

The status LED is also available to the user through the [`statled()`](./engine/stdlib.mdx) API.

## Dimensions

![size comparison](pathname:///img/size-comparison.png)

DUELink modules can be of any size and form; however, they must include mounting holes that are placed on a 5mm grid. On boards with right angle corners, holes must be placed 3.5mm from the edges of the circuit.Holes are 3mm diameter with 6.6mm circle around it with copper keep out.

![Hole Specs](pathname:///img/duelink-hole-specs.png)

This allows for the use of M3 screws and hardware without worrying about creating circuit shorts.

![m3 screw](pathname:///img/m3-screw.png)

The 5mm grid placement of holes aids in 3D-print and laser-cut enclosures design. It also allowed us to make [Holey Boards](catalog/accessory/holey-board)!

![Holeyboard with Modules](pathname:///img/holeyboard-modules.png)

DUELink [Accessories](catalog/accessories) includes all the hardware you need to mount modules.

## Processor

Currently, only STM32C071 is supported with DUELink. We use QFN32 package but fear not we have made [Stick](catalog/microcomputer/stick) to help you make your own modules!

![Pencil Stick](pathname:///img/pencil-stick.png)

The DUELink [Sticker](catalog/accessory/sticker) is a mini development board that uses the [Stick](catalog/microcomputer/stick) to help you get started testing in your own future designs.
