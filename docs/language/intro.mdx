# Hosted languages

![languages](pathname:///img/languages.png)

Several coding languages work with DUELink, including [Python](./python) and [JavaScript](./javascript). We call these "Hosted" because they do not run on modules directly. They run on one of the [Supported Systems](../system/intro).

Beyond hosted languages, DUElink modules can also run [Standalone](../engine/standalone). See the [Non-hosted](./nonhosted) options.
