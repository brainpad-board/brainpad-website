Using MicroPython is very popular on [Raspberry Pi](../system/raspberry-pi) microcontroller-level boards.

We recommend using a board with a JST connector, like [Adafruit QT Py RP2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4900) or [Sparkfun Pro Micro RP2350](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-pro-micro-rp2350.html) but you can use the [Breakout](../catalog/accessory/breakout) to wire any Raspberry Pi Pico.

```python
# code!
