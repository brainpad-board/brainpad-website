[App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) allows anyone, including children, to build mobile apps with ease.

There are 2 ways to access DUELink modules from App Inventor, either USB or Bluetooth.

## USB

This only works with Android as iOS does not support the standard USB CDC Class. As for the modules, you can either use one of the modules with built in USB, such as the ultra-low-cost [CincoBit](../catalog/microcomputer/cincobit) or add [USB Hook](../catalog/accessory/usb-hook).

This example shows how it's done!

## Wireless

Wireless is a bit easier as there is no physical connection to the phone or tablet. These devices can pair with [Wireless Hook](../catalog/accessory/wireless-hook), which in turn brings the chain of [DaisyLink](../engine/daisylink) devices to the [Wireless](../interface/wireless) connection via WiFi or Bluetooth.
