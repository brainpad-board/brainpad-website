# Non-Hosted

---

DUELink is designed from the ground up to work with your favorite [System](../system/intro) and favorite [Language](./intro). Those are **Hosted** languages because they run on a host, that is your board choice. DUELink modules can also run standalone, without a host (Non-hosted).

In this case, the first module (button in this case) is the "Host" who is controlling the other [Daisylinked](../engine/daisylink) modules. The Power modules is just a power source.

Here are some of the options that you can use to turn any DUELink module into a host.

## DUELink Scripting Engine

This is the easiest option and most versatile. The default firmware already includes an [Internal Engine](../engine/intro) that has a [Scripting](../engine/scripting) language. It is easy to learn, making it a great choice for educators, yet it is flexible enough to run complete applications.

Visit the [Internal Engine](../engine/intro) and [Scripting](../engine/scripting) language pages for more details.

## MicroBlocks

This is a block-based coding option, a great choice for educators, young learners, or even anyone who wants to code but without "typing" the code!

Visit [MicroBlocks](./microblocks) to get started.

## C++

ST Micro offers STMCubeIDE as a complete solution to program STM micros. It is free and complete with many options.

Another option is what we use at GHI Electronics, which is [Keil MDK](https://www.keil.com/). This is a paid software but it is licensed to be used for free on STM32C071.

Visit the [C++](./cpp) page to learn more.

## Arduino

Arduino is basically C++ but with easier user-friendly libraries and a very large community.

The [Arduino](../system/arduino) page shows how to use DUELink in a hosted and non-hosted way.
