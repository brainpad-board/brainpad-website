![JavaScript](pathname:///img/javascript.png)

JavaScript is one of the core technologies used by the World Wide Web. 98% of all websites use JavaScript. Websites can now use the provided DUELink JavaScript library to access the physical world.

Here is a website demo to demonstrate how JavaScript can control actuators and read sensors: [demo.duelink.com](https://demo.duelink.com/)

:::tip
TypeScript can also be used alongside the provided JavaScrip libraries

## Setup

This page assumes the user is already familiar with JavaScript and there is a development machine that is already setup to build and run JavaScript programs. We'll be running our program on a local machine using NodeJS.

Install the `duelink` package:

```js
npm install duelink
```

If using serialport, `dlserialusb` package is needed:

```js
npm install dlserialusb
```

:::tip
Make sure your hardware is updated with the latest firmware listed on the [downloads](../downloads.mdx) page.
:::

Start a new project with a simple line of code to test that the project is running.

```js
console.log("Hello World");
```

## Blinky!

Our first program will blink the on-board status LED, on for 200ms then it shuts off for 800ms, and does this 20 times. We will be using SerialUSB() here. If using a web browser, use WebSerial() instead.

```js
const { SerialUSB } = require("dlserialusb");
const { DUELinkController } = require("duelink");

async function Blinky() {
  let duelink = new DUELinkController(new SerialUSB());

  await duelink.Connect();

  // Flash the LED  (on for 200ms, off for 800ms, 20 times)
  await duelink.Led.Set(200, 800, 20);
}

Blinky();
```
