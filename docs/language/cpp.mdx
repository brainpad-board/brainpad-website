There are two ways to use C++ with DUELink, hosted or Standalone.

### Hosted

With a hosted option, a [PC & Laptop](../system/pc-laptop) or [Phone & Tablets](../system/phone-tablet.mdx) can be used to run the C++ program to command DUELink modules through [USB](../interface/usb) or [UART Serial](../interface/uart) interfaces.

This is an example

```
//code

```

## Standalone

With this option, a DUELink module is executing a compiled C++ program developed by you. All modules utilize a STM32C071 microcontroller, which is supported by many IDEs, including free [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html). We however use ARM Keil MDK. This is a paid professional IDE but ST has already licensed it to make it [available for free for any STM32 Cortex-M0 micro](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/kan344/latest/?lang=en).

:::tip
These options use low-end versatile libraries. They are powerful but not user friendly! [Arduino](../system/arduino) is a user-friendly alternative.

```cpp
// example

```

Any DFU update tool can be used to load your compiled program onto a DUELink module. We recommend the [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html).

:::tip
99.9% of modules include SWD pins if you want to connect a debugger, such as ST-Link. SWCLK is found on the through hole "boot pads" or LDR button. SWDIO is found on a tiny SMT pad.
