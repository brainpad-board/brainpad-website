Python is the main language used with AI and data science. The provided DUELink Python library allows a full standard Python program to access the physical world. For example, an AI vision facial recognition can now control a door lock.

## Setup

This page assumes the user is already familiar with Python and there is a development machine that is already setup to build and run Python programs. No changes are needed there but we are using Microsoft Visual Studio Code as a personal preference.

:::tip
Make sure your hardware is updated with the latest firmware listed on the [downloads](../downloads.mdx) page.
:::

Start a new project with a simple line of code to test that the project is running.

```py
print("Hello DUELink!")
```

We now need to install the DUELink Python library using `pip install DUELink`. The DUELink package will also install all required dependencies.

:::tip
The DUELink python library requires pySerial, which may require an admin access to install.

## Blinky!

Our first program will blink the on-board status LED, on for 200ms then it shuts off for 800ms, and does this 20 times.

```py
from DUELink.DUELinkController import DUELinkController
print("Hello DUELink!")
availablePort = DUELinkController.GetConnectionPort()
duelink = DUELinkController(availablePort)
# Flash the LED  (on for 200ms, off for 800ms, 20 times)
duelink.Led.Set(200,800,20)
print("Bye DUELink!")
```

:::tip
The Python library is open source: [DUELink Libraries Repo](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/duelink-libraries).

## Drivers

Each module ship with a driver that adds specific functionality. `duelink.Engine.Run()` is used to access the special added functions provided by the individual modules' drivers.

This example will use the `GetW()` method found on all display modules. A circle will swing left and right to a display of any resolution! We will use color 1 to make this work on color and B&W displays.

```py
from DUELink.DUELinkController import DUELinkController
import time
availablePort = DUELinkController.GetConnectionPort()
duelink = DUELinkController(availablePort)

x = 50
d = 10
width = int(float(duelink.Engine.Run("getw()")))
height = int(float(duelink.Engine.Run("geth()")))

print("Driver Version is:", duelink.Engine.Run("dver()"))

while True:
    duelink.Graphics.Circle(1, x, height//2, 10)
    duelink.Graphics.Show()

    x = x + d

    if (x > width or x < 0):
        d = d * -1
        duelink.Graphics.Clear(0)

    time.sleep(0.1)
```
