# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>Is the scripting engine fast? Is it realtime</summary>

  The [Internal Engine](./engine/intro) is optimized for very tiny systems. It is made to handle sensors and actuators from within as [Standalone](./engine/standalone) or work with several [Hosted Languages](./language/intro). It will not execute tasks as fast as native compilation and it is not reltime.

  However, you can wipe out the micro and load it with super fast compiled code that runs real time. You can use commercial grade [Keil MDK](https://www.keil.com/) with free STM32 license to code using [C++](./language/cpp) or even use [Arduino](./system/arduino) for an easier alternative.

  <summary>How do I use a different language or a different system?</summary>

  No problem! You can base your work on one of the available [Hosted Language](./language/intro) options to start porting to whatever you need. If there is a common need, then we might do the work for you even! Tell the [community](https://forums.ghielectronics.com/c/duelink/31) what you are thinking and let's make this a group effort.

  <summary>Can I make my own DUELink modules?</summary>

  By all means! You are welcome to take advantage of everything on this website. [Download](./downloads) the firmware to run your modules, use any of the schematics on the [Catalog](./catalog/intro), use the libraries we provide for any [Hosted Language](./language/intro).

  The only restriction is that you can't use our DUELink or GHI Electronics logos without our written approval.

  <summary>Is this like Qwiic and Stemma?</summary>

  All mentioned use the same connector and work on I2C but this is 1% of what DUELink offers. For starter, DUELink works on multiple [Interfaces](./interface/intro). When it comes to [I2C](./interface/i2c) DUELink has a single address that is used to communicate with the entire bus.

  But things do not end at hardware. There is an [InternalEngine](./engine/intro) which allows these modules modules to work with [Standalone](./engine/standalone) or allow them to be commanded from several [Supported Systems](./system/intro), such as [Phones & Tablets](./system/phone-tablet), then be codded in many [Hosted Languages](./language/intro), including [Python](./language/python) and [JavaScript](./language/javascript)

  <summary>Can use with Grove and others?</summary>

  You can use DUELink modules side-by-side with virtually any non-DUELink I2C modules! If your modules connect using [I2C](./interface/i2c) then just plug in your I2C devices first in the [Daisylink](./engine/daisylink) and then add as many DUELink modules as you like, right after.
