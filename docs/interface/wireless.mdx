Cut the wire and use DUELink modules wirelessly! There are several ways to accomplish this but the easiest one is via using a wireless connection from a [PC/Laptop](../system/pc-laptop) or [Phone/Tablet](../system/phone-tablet) connected to [Wireless Hook](../catalog/accessory/wireless-hook).

The Wireless Hook module utilizes the virtual serial interface over WiFi or Bluetooth just like they would with [UART Serial](uart) or [USB](usb).
