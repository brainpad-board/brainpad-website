# Interfaces

---

Every single DUELink module work with [USB](./usb), [I2C](./i2c), and [UART](./uart) on their Uplink socket. Some modules are made in a [microcomputer](../catalog/microcomputers) form-factor and; therefore, the Uplink socket is replaced with a USB connector.

[Supported Systems](../system/intro) can use the above interfaces with one of the [Hosted Languages](../language/intro).

The [downlink](./downlink) socket is automatically handled by the system and allows for [dasylinking](../engine/daisylink) modules.

DUELink doesn't stop there as it also provided ways for connecting modules over a [wireless](./wireless) connection.
