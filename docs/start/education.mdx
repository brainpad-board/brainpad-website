DUELink shines in education. The entire plug-and-play system is user friendly and works for learners of every age.

## Hardware 

We recommend the ultra-low-cost [CincoBit](../catalog/microcomputer/cincobit) or its OLED display sister, [PixoBit](../catalog/microcomputer/pixobit). From here you have many [Hosted language](../language/intro) options to command these boards to do whatever you like, or you can simply program the boards directly, with zero software to install, using the [Console](../console).

If [Arduino](../system/arduino) is your choice of IDE, then we recommend [DueDuino](../catalog/microcomputer/dueduino).

## Software

On the software front, the [Console](../console) includes everything an educator needs to help students start typing code. It runs in a browser and requires no installations.

If block coding is desired, [MicroBlocks](../language/microblocks) is a fantastic choice for multiple reasons! Users can run MicroBlocks on the web or they can download local offline software. Also, MicroBlocks VM has been ported to DUELink modules, allowing any module to host MicroBlocks.

Artificial Intelligence (AI), and data science students love [Python](../language/python), which is one of the many supported [languages](../language/intro).
