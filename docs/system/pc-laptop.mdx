A PC or Laptop running Windows, Linux, or Mac can finally have easy access to hundreds of sensors and actuators. There are many [Hosted Language](../language/intro) options to cover every need.

Our [demo](../start/demo) is built using [JavaScript](../language/javascript) and offers an excellent starting point to play with DUELink modules and see how the web can be used to access sensors and actuators.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications that use [Python](../language/python) can take advantage the entire DUELink ecosystem. This demo uses facial detection to move a servo (to open a door!)

[USB Hook](../catalog/accessory/usb-hook) is used to bridge the [Servo X1](../catalog/actuator/servo-x1) Module, but any other modules, or multiple modules can used as well.

```python

```

WiFi or Bluetooth can also be used instead of USB. In fact, the PC libraries do not care what medium is being used. It sees a virtual serial port in any of these cases. [Wireless Hook](../catalog/accessory/wireless-hook) is an excellent module for this use.
