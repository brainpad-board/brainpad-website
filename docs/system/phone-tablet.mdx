DUELink module versatility allows it to work with Phones and Tablets. The modules on-board [Scripting](../engine/scripting) engine is accessible from many [Interfaces](../interface/intro) and in this case a serial [UART](../interface/uart) connection is all it takes.

When connecting to an Android system, any DUElink module will present itself as a virtual serial connection. You can quickly try it by installing any serial terminal program to send commands.

Similarly, a [Python](../language/python), [JavaScript](../language/javascript) or [C++](../language/cpp) can be used, as long as you have access to the virtual serial port.

In other cases, using a wireless connection over WiFi or Bluetooth might be desired.

Similar to USB, wireless connectivity offers a virtual serial connection. Use [Wireless Hook](../catalog/accessory/wireless-hook) module to command modules through a wireless connection from a phone or a tablet. See [Wireless Interface](../interface/wireless) for more details.

## Block Coding

Support goes beyond typed coding and into block-coding, such as [App Inventor](../language/app-inventor). This educational app-building-tool allows users to build apps using a simple drag and drop IDE.
