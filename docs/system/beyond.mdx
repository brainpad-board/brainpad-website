Have another system in mind? Like the powerful NVIDIA Jetson Nano, or a tiny ESP32?

Any system should also work with DUELink. As long as that system has one of the supported [Interfaces](../interface/intro) then it can take advantage DUELink modules.

Jump in the [forum](https://forums.ghielectronics.com/c/duelink/31) and let us know which board you would like to see us add next.
