There are multiple ways to take advantage of the DUELink ecosystem with the entire Raspberry Pi product line.

## RPI and RPI Zero

![DuePi](pathname:///img/catalog/duepi-front.png)

We recommend using [DuePi](../catalog/accessory/duepi.mdx) Hat. The hat uses [UART](../interface/uart) and works with both full-size Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Zero. It includes a display, buzzer, terminal block for wiring, and a [Downlink](../interface/downlink) socket to extend your RPI with hundreds of sensors and actuators.

Everything is accessible through any of the RPI supported [Hosted Languages](../language/intro), such as [Python](../language/python) .

```python
# Show IP address on display
print("Bye DUE!")
# Beep once a second
```

Here is an example that reads temperature from a temp sensor:

```python
# Read Temp from sensor on downlink

# Show on built-in display
```

Another option is to use use breakout boards that bring the RPIâ€™s [I2C](../interface/i2c) bus to a standard JST socket, like the [Sparkfun Qwiic Shim for Raspberry Pi](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-qwiic-shim-for-raspberry-pi.html) or [Sparkfun Qwiic pHat](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-qwiic-phat-v2-0-for-raspberry-pi.html).

![Sparkfun Qwiic Shim or Qwiic pHat](pathname:///img/qwiic-shim-phat.png)

:::tip
When using the Qwiic pHat, only use one socket as [Downlink](../interface/downlink). You can use the other sockets to connect other, non-DUELink things.
:::

Same code as before but we are now using the I2C bus.

```python
# Read Temp

# Print to Console
```

## Raspberry Pi Pico

Using Raspberry Pi Pico is simply done using [DuePico](../catalog/accessory/duepico). It includes a display to help you with printing diagnostics info and a [downlink](../interface/downlink) socket to help you [daisylink](../engine/daisylink) modules.

## RP2350 & RP2040

Beyond the official RPI Pico, using any board with a RPI microcontroller is possible. We recommend ones with a JST connector, like [Adafruit QT Py RP2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4900) or [Sparkfun Pro Micro RP2350](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-pro-micro-rp2350.html) but you can use the [Breakout](../catalog/accessory/breakout) to wire any other boards as well.

![RP2040-RP2350-Breakout](pathname:///img/rp2040-rp2350-breakout.png)

:::tip
Pay attention to how much power these little circuits can provide. Consider adding a [Power Inject](../catalog/accessory/power-inject) module to add more juice!
:::

[MicroPython](../language/micropython) is one of the supported options. Here we are showing the light level on a display.

```python
# Read light

# Show on display

```
