![Supported Systems](pathname:///img/duelink-supported-systems.png)

DUELink modules work with several systems, from [Raspberry Pi](./raspberry-pi), [Arduino](./arduino) & [BeagleBoard](./beagleboard) to [Phones and Tablets](phone-tablet), or [PC's & Laptops](./pc-laptop.mdx). These systems work with one or more of the supported [Hosted Languages](../language/intro).

Modules connect to these systems over several [Interfaces](../interface/intro). Some SBCs come with a compatible JST connector already on-board that uses these [Interfaces](../interface/intro).

You do not have to use any of these systems as DUELink modules can also run [Standalone](../engine/standalone) using the [Internal Engine](../engine/intro).
