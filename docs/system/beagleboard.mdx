BeagleBoard has many open-source offerings and they all work with the DUELink ecosystem.

Any of the [Hosted Language](../language/intro) options can be use on these boards. Depending on the boards, there might be an easier way to connect DUELink modules.

## BeaglePlay

This board has a built in JST connector with [I2C](../interface/i2c) signals, I2C5 to be exact! Their [Qwicc Example](https://docs.beagleboard.org/boards/beagleplay/demos-and-tutorials/using-qwiic.html#beagleplay-qwiic) is a good starting point on how to access the I2C bus. Consider this as a DUELink [Downlink](../interface/downlink) socket.

## BeagleY-AI

This board has a [Raspberry PI](raspberry-pi) compatible footprint/pinout. We recommend using DUELink [DuePI](../catalog/accessory/duepi), which adds a display, a buzzer, a terminal block, and [Downlink](../interface/downlink) socket.

The hat uses UART for communication. Here is an example to show the systemâ€™s IP address on the display.

# Other Beagles

Use the [Breakout](../catalog/accessory/breakout) module to wire [I2C](../interface/i2c) or [UART](../interface/uart) from any Beagle board and use one of its sockets as DUELink [Downlink](../interface/downlink) connection.

Here is BeagleBone Black connected to a light sensor.
