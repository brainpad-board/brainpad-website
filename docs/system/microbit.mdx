micro:bit is an educational board with on-board LEDs and sensors, plus it has edge pads allowing it to plug into accessories.

Some of those pads have holes, supporting alligator clips.

## Alternatives

If you enjoy the edge connector and alligator clips, DUELink offers bit-compatible boards, such as the ultra-low-cost [CincoBit](../catalog/microcomputer/cincobit) and also [PixoBit](../catalog/microcomputer/pixobit) that includes a display.

The DUELink [CincoBit](../catalog/microcomputer/cincobit) and [PixoBit](../catalog/microcomputer/pixobit) work like all other DUELink modules, through DUELink [Scripting Engine](../engine/scripting) or the [Arduino](arduino) IDE, among other [Hosted Language](../language/intro) options. These microcomputers can be used with micro:bit accessories, like in this robot!

## micro:bit with DUELink Modules

To connect micro:bit to one of the many DUElink modules, you can use an accessory with a JST connector such as [Sparkfun Qwiic micro:bit Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-qwiic-micro-bit-breakout.html)

![micro:bit](pathname:///img/microbit-breakout.png)

One of the two JST sockets becomes a [Downlink](../interface/downlink) bringing you hundreds of DUELink module options, that connect in a [Daisylink](../engine/daisylink).

## Software options

There are multiple options to program micro:bit to use DUELink modules. We are only going to list the ones we have tested.

### MakeCode

Microsoft [MakeCode](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode) is the most used interface with micro:bit. It is block-based, making it an easy choice for beginners and young learners.

Our [MakeCode](../language/makecode) page has everything you need.

### MicroPython

This is one of the well supported options with DUELink.

### MicroBlocks

This is a great option to program micro:bit using blocks.
